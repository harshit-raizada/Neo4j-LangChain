# Neo4j-LangChain

This project leverages Neo4j GraphDB and LangChain to create a sophisticated question-answering system. By utilizing Cypher Query Language, nodes, labels, and relationships are dynamically created and managed within the graph database. The core functionality is built around a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application, designed to provide accurate answers based on the provided textual data. The underlying language model powering this application is groq.
